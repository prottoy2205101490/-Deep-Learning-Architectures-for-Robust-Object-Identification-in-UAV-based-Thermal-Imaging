# -Deep-Learning-Architectures-for-Robust-Object-Identification-in-UAV-based-Thermal-Imaging

In recent years, various industries have been experiencing a notable
increase in the use of machine learning for object recognition, resulting in the
development of different methods and technologies. Thermal detection
technology is one such aspect that uses thermal images captured from objects to
determine them based on their heat signatures. This has been particularly useful
in situations like surveillance, search and rescue missions, and nighttime
operations where conventional imaging techniques are limited by poor visibility
or darkness. The advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has even widened
the scope of practical application of thermal imaging. In situations such as
monitoring wildfires or carrying out search and rescue operations, UAVs fitted
with thermographic cameras can cover large areas within a short time. The
combination of UAVs and thermal detection technology has greatly improved
thermal data acquisition expanding its reach into fields such as disaster relief,
animal tracking among others including industry inspections. In this study, we
used the HIT-UAV dataset which has much popularity in object identification
research to investigate the efficiency of the latest YOLOv8 model more
accurately the YOLOv8m and YOLOv8s by comparing these models to its
previous version YOLOv5 models. Through our implementation of YOLOv8m
on the HIT-UAV dataset we were able to achieve precision of 87.6% and mean
average score of 81.9% and with YOLOv8s we were able to achieve precision
of 89.1% and mean average score of 82.3%
